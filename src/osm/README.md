## ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ [Explanation of OSRM Map-Matching Algorithm and API Response](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/2933#issuecomment-249068441) ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘

> @wiva-koikoi It sounds like you are misunderstanding the API response and how
> the map-matching algorithm works.
>
> The elements of matchings are not connected - if your trace matches without
> error, then matchings array should only have 1 entry. The fact that you've got 4
> means that OSRM split your coordinates into 4 partial matches with gaps between.
> The matching algorithm is probabilistic and your GPS data is noisy - it's not
> going to give you a perfect result every time.
>
> For coordinate [16], you've supplied a radius of 15m. OSRM will search for up to
> 3x that distance for a road to snap to, and will give up if it can't find one.
>
> Here's that point highlighted:

>
> You've specified a bearing of 74 +/- 120 for this coordinate. The nearest road
> that matches that is about 65m away. This coordinate is failing to snap to
> anything and is being discarded, causing a break in your trace.
>
> You should not draw the matchings geometries as connected - they are not, they
> represent partial matches from your original sequence of coordinates.
>
> The tracepoints array are your original points, and the the matching_index and
> waypoint_index properties tell you which partial match each tracepoint was
> included in. If your trace is clean and matches well, then they will all have
> matching_index: 0.
>
> Given how far from the road your coordinate [16] is, it sounds like you need to
> check your GPS accuracy reading - it was much worse than 15m. Either that, or
> there's a road that's not on the map, in which case we wouldn't want to snap to
> the wrong road anyway.
>
> You can try iteratively removing these failed points yourself - if you get a
> null response, drop that point and re-try the request, see if the matches get
> connected. Note that there's a ~500m max distance between points before traces
> get split.
>
> The map-matching algorithm was tuned based on GPS data from a car arriving at
> about 10 second intervals, with ~5m accuracy. It works quite well for coarser
> and finer data than that, but if you drift too far from the expected model,
> you'll start to see more splits.

[OSRM Tile service](https://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api/#tile-service)

> This service generates Mapbox Vector Tiles that can be viewed with a
> vector-tile capable slippy-map viewer. The tiles contain road geometries and
> metadata that can be used to examine the routing graph. The tiles are generated
> directly from the data in-memory, so are in sync with actual routing results,
> and let you examine which roads are actually routable, and what weights they
> have applied.
